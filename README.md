# 🎬 Intelligent Movie Recommender
A Python-based movie recommendation system that leverages machine learning to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. This project demonstrates skills in data processing, similarity-based algorithms, and application development.
📖 Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system. It uses a dataset of movies and a precomputed similarity matrix to suggest movies similar to a user's input. The system is built as a web application using Streamlit, making it user-friendly and interactive.
🎯 Features

Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies based on content similarity.
Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.
Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes preprocessed movie data (movies.pkl) and similarity scores (similarity.pkl).
Scalable Design: Modular code structure for easy enhancements.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For the web application interface.
Pandas/NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
Scikit-learn: For computing similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity).
Pickle: For serializing and loading preprocessed data.
Git: Version control with .gitignore and .gitattributes for large file handling (Git LFS).

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git
Git LFS (for handling similarity.pkl)

Installation

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/Intelligent-Movie-Recommender-Python.git
cd Intelligent-Movie-Recommender-Python


Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Git LFS (if not already installed):git lfs install
git lfs pull



Usage

Run the Streamlit app:streamlit run app.py


Open the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
Enter a movie title or select from available options to get recommendations.

├── app.py               # Main Streamlit application
├── movies.pkl           # Preprocessed movie dataset
├── similarity.pkl       # Precomputed similarity matrix
├── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
├── .gitignore           # Files/folders to ignore in Git
├── .gitattributes       # Git LFS configuration

🔍 How It Works

Data Preparation: The movies.pkl file contains a preprocessed dataset of movies (e.g., titles, genres, or other features).
Similarity Computation: The similarity.pkl file stores a precomputed similarity matrix (e.g., cosine similarity between movie features).
Recommendation Logic: When a user inputs a movie, the system retrieves similar movies based on the similarity matrix.
Web Interface: Streamlit provides an interactive UI to input movie names and display recommendations.

🌟 Why This Project?

Showcases ML Skills: Demonstrates proficiency in building recommendation algorithms.
Practical Application: Real-world use case for personalized content delivery.
Clean Code Practices: Modular, well-documented, and version-controlled codebase.
Professional Tools: Uses Git LFS for large files and Streamlit for modern web apps.
